## Analysis

- Total Import Value and Quantity: Bahrain spends billions on imports every year, with large volumes of goods entering the country.

- Top Countries: A small number of countries account for most imports, which increases dependency on them.

- Top Categories: Essential items like medicines are unavoidable, but other categories could be replaced by local production.

- Yearly Trends: Imports dropped in 2020 during COVID-19, then increased again with recovery in 2021.

- Key Insight: High import costs (including shipping) reduce the benefit to the local economy. Supporting local industries can keep this money within Bahrain and strengthen the national economy.
