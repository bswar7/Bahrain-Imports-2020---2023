## Description

This project analyzes Bahrain’s import data from 2020 to 2023. The goal is to understand import trends, identify the top countries and product categories, and highlight the impact of imports on the local economy, providing clear insights and actionable findings.

## Dataset

The dataset is taken from the [Bahrain Open Data Portal:](https://www.data.gov.bh/explore/?disjunctive.theme&sort=modified&q=import)

[2020](https://www.data.gov.bh/explore/dataset/06-import-2020/table/?sort=-n)

[2021](https://www.data.gov.bh/explore/dataset/05-import-2021/table/?sort=-n)

[2022](https://www.data.gov.bh/explore/dataset/04-import-2022/table/)

[2023](https://www.data.gov.bh/explore/dataset/01-import-non-oil-classified-by-commodity-and-country-for-2023/table/?disjunctive.month&disjunctive.country_name)


## Analysis

**Total Import Value and Quantity:** Bahrain spends billions on imports every year, with large volumes of goods entering the country.

**Top Countries:** A small number of countries account for most imports, which increases dependency on them.

**Top Categories:** Essential items like medicines are unavoidable, but other categories could be replaced by local production.

**Yearly Trends:** Imports dropped in 2020 during COVID-19, then increased again during the recovery period in 2022–2023.

## Key Insights

- During COVID-19 (2020) imports decreased significantly, but with recovery in 2022–2023 imports rose again. This shows why we should not depend too strongly on a limited number of countries, because any crisis can directly affect our economy.

- The Top 10 import countries take the majority share of imports, which shows high dependency. Relying too much on a few countries can be risky — any global crisis in these countries directly impacts Bahrain’s economy.

- By analyzing import categories, we can identify the largest imported goods. Some of these can have local alternatives, which would support local industries and reduce dependency on imports.

- High import costs (including shipping) reduce the benefit to the local economy. Supporting local manufacturing keeps the money inside Bahrain and strengthens the national economy.
